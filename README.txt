This is our final project for WEBDEV.

This project is simple and easy to understand. Just put an amount and choose what country you want to convert the currency.
After converting it will show how much is the converted amount cost on the crypto coins.

How to set it up locally?
1. Just download the file.
2. After Downloading, open Terminal then type "node server.js"
3. Open your browser and type the url localhost:3000 then enjoy the software.

Happy Coding!
